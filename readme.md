## Intro
3D-Collision Simulator is created by a group of students in their 3rd year at Damascus University.

## Technologies
* The simulator is built using Three JS graphics library which uses WebGL.
* All Physics and Mathematics used were implemented and tested by us.

## Setup
To run the project on a **Local Host** download [Three.js](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Installation/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) then run the following commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
